Add whole milk to a large saucepan and heat over medium. Add the pistachio mixture and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer. Once simmering, remove from heat and cover with a lid. Allow to steep for 1 hour. Strain the pistachios out of the mixture, pressing down as you strain to release as much flavor as possible. Return the milk mixture to the saucepan and again bring it to a simmer. Once it starts to simmer, remove the pan from the heat. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and remaining granulated sugar until smooth and pale yellow in color. Add about \\xBD cup of the hot milk to the egg and sugar mixture and whisk constantly until combined. Then, add the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining hot milk. Heat the saucepan on low. Stirring constantly, heat until the base has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. This should take a few minutes. Strain the mixture into a bowl to remove any pieces of egg that may have cooked. Add the heavy cream, vanilla extract, and almond extract and stir to combine. Then, add green food coloring, a little at a time, until you reach your desired green coloring. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap making sure to have the plastic wrap touching the surface of the ice cream base. This will help keep it from forming a skin while chilling.
